Introduction:
Nine volunteers wearing three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a heart rate monitor 
participated in eighteen various physical activities (such as walking, cycling, and soccer) that are 
included in the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset.

The aim of the report:
The exercise's objectives were to use real-world data analysis techniques to this dataset and 
generate discoveries that a wearable technology manufacturer may find valuable.
We want our product to be superior to our main competitors such as Wireless InertiaCube3 by 
InterSense, MTw Awinda by Xsens, T40s by Vicon, and OptoTrak 3020 by Optotrak Certus.
So, the goal is to develop hardware and/or software which can lower the cost and that will be 
able to predict type of activity that the user is performing and what should be the heartrate.
